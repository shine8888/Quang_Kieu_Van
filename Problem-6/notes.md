### API Endpoints

The Scoreboard API module provides the following endpoints:

#### PUT /scores

This endpoint is used to update the score for a user. It expects the following parameters in the request body:

- `userId`: The ID of the user whose score needs to be updated.
- `score`: The new score for the user.

The API performs the following actions:

1. Verifies the authenticity and authorization of the request.
2. Updates the score for the specified user in the database.
3. Broadcasts the updated score to the website frontend for real-time update.

#### Additional Improvements

1. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can update their scores.
2. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect the API from excessive requests.
3. Add error handling and proper response codes in case of any failures or errors.
4. Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce database load.
5. Add logging and monitoring to track API usage and identify any issues or anomalies.

### Dependencies

The Scoreboard API module depends on the following components:

- Database Server: The module interacts with the database server to update and retrieve scores.
- Website Frontend: The module broadcasts real-time score updates to the website frontend.

### Setup and Configuration

To set up and configure the Scoreboard API module, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies and libraries.
2. Configure the connection to the database server.
3. Set up authentication and authorization mechanisms.
4. Configure real-time update mechanisms (e.g., websockets or push notifications).
5. Implement error handling and logging mechanisms.
6. Deploy the API service to a suitable environment.

### Testing

To test the Scoreboard API module, perform the following steps:

1. Send a PUT request to the `/scores` endpoint with a valid `userId` and `score` in the request body.
2. Verify that the score gets updated in the database.
3. Verify that the website frontend receives the real-time score update.
4. Test the API with different scenarios, including invalid requests, unauthorized access attempts, and error conditions.
5. Monitor the API performance and ensure it meets the required response time and scalability metrics.

### Conclusion

The Scoreboard API module provides the necessary functionality to update scores and provide real-time updates to the website scoreboard. By implementing authentication, authorization, and other improvements, the module ensures the security and integrity of the score updates. The module can be deployed and tested in a suitable environment to meet the requirements of the website.
